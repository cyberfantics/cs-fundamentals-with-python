## Overview

**Problem Solving with Python** is a structured repository focused on mastering **Python programming**, **logical reasoning**, and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** through well-implemented problem solutions.

The repository emphasizes **clarity, readability, and correctness**, making it suitable for **technical interview preparation, academic reinforcement, and professional upskilling**. Every solution highlights a **concept-first approach**, ensuring learners understand **why** a solution works, not just **how**.

## Objectives

This repository aims to:

* Build strong problem-solving and analytical thinking skills
* Reinforce Python fundamentals through applied examples
* Bridge theoretical computer science concepts with practical implementation
* Serve as a reference for technical interview preparation
* Promote learning through clear explanations and clean code

## Professional Focus

All implementations adhere to **industry standards**:

* Consistent and readable coding style
* Maintainable and scalable Python solutions
* Concept-first problem-solving methodology
* Alignment with software engineering and AI-focused interview expectations

## Interview Readiness

The content prepares candidates to:

* Explain reasoning behind algorithmic and data structure choices
* Discuss trade-offs in efficiency, complexity, and scalability
* Analyze time and space complexity critically
* Communicate solutions clearly under interview conditions

Effective explanation of solutions is as critical as coding ability in professional interviews.
